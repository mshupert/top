        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1&frasl;2 cups elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>1&frasl;4 cup butter</li>
            <li>1&frasl;4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1&frasl;2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>4 cups milk</li>
            <li>1 pound shredder Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1&frasl;4 cup butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 sleeve buttery round crackers, crushed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F 
                (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow 
                macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until 
                tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain well.</li>
            <li>Melt 1&frasl;4 cup butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. 
                Stir in flour and salt; cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. 
                Whisk in milk and simmer, stirring frequently, until mixture 
                thickens slightly, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and stir in Cheddar cheese, in batches, until 
                cheese is melted. Add macaroni and stir to coat.</li>
            <li>Pour into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Mix the remaining 1&frasl;4 
                cup of melted butter and crushed crackers together in a bowl; 
                scatter evenly over macaroni mixture.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown on top, about 
                45 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
